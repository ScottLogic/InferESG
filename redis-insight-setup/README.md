# Redis Insight Setup

This is a GUI for Redis. Access at http://localhost:5540/

## Database connection
To connect to the redis database the internal docker url needs to be used "host.docker.internal:6379"

The redis-insight-setup sidecar should automatically configure this database connection on startup.
