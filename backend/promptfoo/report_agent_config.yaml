Supplier name: Amazon Web Services EU SARL (UK Branch)  (“AWS UK”)
Publication date: September 30, 2024
Commitment to Achieving Net Zero
AWS UK, as part of Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”), is committed to achieving net -zero
emissions by 2040. In 2019, Amazon co -founded The Climate Pledge, a public commitment
to innovate, use our scale for good and go faster to address the urgency of the climate crisis
to reach net -zero carbon across the entire organization by 2040. Since committing to the
Pledge, we’ve changed how we conduct our business and the running of our operations, and
we’ve increased funding and implementation of new technologies and services that
decarbonize and help preserve the natural world, alon gside the ambitious goals outlined in
The Climate Pledge. We’re fully committed to our goals and our work to build a better planet.
Baseline Emissions Footprint
Base Year emissions are a record of the greenhouse gases that have been produced in the
past an d are the reference point against which emissions reduction can be measured.
Baseline Year: 2020
Additional Details relating to the Baseline Emissions calculations:
AWS UK utilized January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 as the baseline year for emissions
reporting under this Carbon Reduction Plan. Our plan includes emissions data from relevant
affiliate companies helping to provide AWS UK’s services to our customers. We ’ve included both
location -based and market -based method Scope 2 emissions in the following tables. AWS UK
benefits from contractual arrangements entered into by our affiliate(s) for renewable electricity
and/or renewable attributes that are reflected in t he market -based data set. More information
about our corporate carbon footprint and methodology can be found on our website .
Our baseline year does not include Scope 1 emissions. In 2022 we updated our methodology
and Scope 1 emissions are now included in total emissions for AWS UK

 Published September 2024  Emissions Reduction Targets
In 2019, we set an ambitious goal to match 100% of the electricity we use with renewable
energy by 2030. This goal includes all data centres , logistics facilities, physical stores, and
corporate offices, as well as on -site charg ing points and our financially integrated subsidiaries.
We are proud to have achieved this goal in 2023, seven years early, with 100% of the electricity
consum ed by Amazon matched with renewable energy sources.
Amazon continue s to be transparent and share our progress  to reach net -zero carbon  in our
annual  Sustainability Report , which also includes details on how we  measure carbon .
Carbon Reduction Projects
Completed Carbon Reduction Initiatives
Amazon continues to take actions across our operations to drive carbon reduction around  the
world, including in the UK. As of January 202 4, Amazon’s renewable energy portfolio includes
243 wind and solar farms and 2 70 rooftop solar projects, totalling 513 projects  and 28
gigawatts of renewable energy capacity.  This includes several utility -scale renewable energy
projects located within the UK:
•In 2019, Amazon  announced our first power purchase agreement in the UK, located in
Kintyre Peninsula, Scotland. The “Amazon Wind Farm Scotland – Beinn an Tuirc 3”
began o perating in 2021, providing 50 megawatts  (MW)  of new renewable capacity to
the electricity grid with expected generation of 168,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of
clean energy annually. That’s enough to power 46,000 UK homes every year.
•In December 2020,  Amazon a nnounced a two -phase renewable energy project located
in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, the Kennoxhead wind farm. Kennoxhead will be the
largest single -site onshore wind project in the UK, enabled through corporate
procurement.  Once fully operational, Kenno xhead will produce 129 MW of renewable
capacity and is expected to generate 439,000 MWh of clean energy annually. Phase 1
(60 MW) began operating in 2022, and Phase 2 (69  MW) will begin operations in 2024 .
•In 2022, Amazon announced its first project in Nor thern Ireland, a 16  MW onshore
windfarm in Co Antrim.
•In 2022, Amazon  also announced  a new 473 MW offshore wind farm, Moray West,
located off the coast of Scotland . Amazon expects completion of Moray West in 2024.
This is Amazon’s largest project in Scotland and the largest corporate renewable
energy deal announced by any company in the UK to date.
•In 2023, Amazon announced a new 47  MW solar farm, Warl ey located in Essex.
This project is expected to be operational in 2024.
