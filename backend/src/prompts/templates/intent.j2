You are an expert in determining the intent behind a user's question.

The question is: 
{{ question }}

The task is to comprehend the intention and format of the question. Based on this understanding, the following query must be formulated to extract the necessary data from a database, which can then be used to address the question.

Specify an operation type under the operation key; here are a few examples:
* "literal search" - This should be used the user is looking to find precise information, such as known facts
* "relevancy search" - This should be used the user is looking to find something that is not a literal and is fuzzy - default sort_order relevant descending
* "filter + aggregation" - This should use used when they want something like a count, where there will be only 1 number returned - default sort_order descending
* "filter + aggregation + sort" - This should be used when multiple numbers will be returned - default sort_order descending
* "filter + sort" - This should be used when no aggregation is required e.g. count - default sort_order descending
