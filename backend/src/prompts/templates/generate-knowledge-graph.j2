You are an expert in Cypher and Neo4j. I need your help with ESG data represented as a JSON object. The JSON structure is as follows:

{"all_data": data}

Here, `data` is a list of lists, where each inner list corresponds to a row of data, with the first row being the header. The Cypher query should use this JSON structure to extract and process the data for Neo4j.

Please perform the following:

1. Analyze the data structure, including the headers in the first row and each fieldâ€™s content and relationships.
2. Create a Cypher query that imports the data from this JSON object into Neo4j, transforming it into nodes and relationships based on the structure inferred from the data. Each unique entity should be a node, and relationships should be based on how fields relate to each other.
3. Skip the header row when unwinding data and process only the data rows. The header row should only be used to infer field names and should not be processed as data.
4. Build a map of each row by pairing each header from data.all_data[0] with its corresponding value in row. Handle empty or missing values using COALESCE:
    * For empty textual fields, use COALESCE(value, 'Unknown').
    * For missing numeric values, use COALESCE(value, 0).
5. Ensure headers remain defined in each WITH clause where they are referenced:
    * Explicitly carry the headers variable in each WITH clause where it is needed. If a variable is defined earlier in the query, ensure it is passed forward in subsequent WITH clauses to avoid any "undefined variable" errors.
    * When defining new variables, always include headers and any other relevant variables (e.g., row) in the WITH clause to ensure they remain accessible throughout the query.
6. Avoid using apoc.map.fromLists. Instead, construct the map manually within Cypher, using headers and row values directly.

ESG-Specific Data Structure and Relationships
* Identify fields related to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) categories. If suitable, these fields should be captured on the appropriate ESG category node which has a relationship with parent node for the row.
    * Link environmental fields (e.g., env_score, co2_emissions, energy_use) to an Environment node, with each metric as a property on this node.
    * Link social fields (e.g., social_score, injury_rate, human_rights) to a Social node, with relevant metrics.
    * Link governance fields (e.g., gov_score, board_size, shareholder_rights) to a Governance node.

Data JSON Format:
{
"all_data": {{ csv_input }}
}

Guidelines for the Cypher Query:
* Start with `WITH $data AS data UNWIND data.all_data[1..] AS row WITH data.all_data[0] AS headers, row WITH headers, row`.
* Use the first row as the header to extract column names, and process the subsequent rows as data entries.
* Explicitly carry headers in each WITH clause:
    * After setting headers with data.all_data[0] AS headers, ensure headers is retained by including it in each WITH clause where it is needed, alongside any other variables (e.g., row, values).
* For each row, construct a map by pairing each header (from `data.all_data[0]`) with the corresponding value in `row`. Apply default values using `COALESCE`, for example, `COALESCE(row[index], 'Unknown')` for text fields or `COALESCE(row[index], 0)` for numeric fields.
* Set default values for any empty or missing fields in data rows, as specified. Assume that headers in the first row will always be present and do not need defaults.

Output format:
Provide the output in raw JSON format only, without any additional markup, code block delimiters, or extraneous characters. The JSON should include two fields:

`"cypher_query"`: The Cypher query you generate to import the data into Neo4j. Do not include specific values or extracts from the example data itself. Only reference fields generically using the map structure, like `entry.FieldName`, since the actual data will be passed in separately.
`"explanation"`: A non-technical description of the entities and relationships identified in the input data. Do not discuss how the query works. Instead, focus on describing the entities and their relationships as you understand them from the data.

Make sure the output is valid JSON with no additional formatting, code block markers, or line breaks.

Example Input:
{'all_data': [['Identifier (RIC)', 'Company Name', 'Date', 'ESG_score', 'Social_score', 'Gov_score', 'Env_score', 'BVPS', 'Market_cap', 'Shares', 'Industry', 'Net_income', 'RETURN_ON_ASSET', 'QUICK_RATIO', 'ASSET_GROWTH', 'FNCL_LVRG', 'PE_RATIO', 'Scope_1', 'Scope_2', 'CO2_emissions', 'Energy_use', 'Water_use', 'Water_recycle', 'Toxic_chem_red', 'Injury_rate', 'Women_Employees', 'Human_Rights', 'Strikes', 'Turnover_empl', 'Board_Size', 'Shareholder_Rights', 'Board_gen_div', 'Bribery', 'Recycling_Initiatives', 'Total_assets'], ['AAL', 'American Airlines Group Inc', '2021', '59.02910721', '64.28601828', '56.39811612', '54.38515247', '-11.39725006', '10198305438', '644015000', 'Airlines', '-1993000000', '-3.1032', '0.7333', '7.1507', '34.6286', '5.8534', '898.9575031', '6.470219367', '41439616', '551629386', '1873777.95', '', '0', '', '41', '1', '1', '5.8', '10', '1', '20', '1', '0', '66467000000'], ['AAL', 'American Airlines Group Inc', '2020', '69.40117811', '68.81448509', '83.94361492', '56.96600148', '-14.19130047', '10626751115', '483888000', 'Airlines', '-8885000000', '-14.5652', '0.4953', '3.3553', '34.6286', '5.8534', '904.2455266', '7.364001706', '40604000', '540190224', '1729932.37', '', '0', '', '41.618', '1', '0', '5.5', '12', '1', '16.66666667', '1', '0', '62008000000']]}

Example Output:

{ "cypher_query": "YOUR CYPHER QUERY HERE", "explanation": "YOUR EXPLANATION HERE" }

Important Notes:
* Avoid using apoc.map.fromLists and instead pair headers and row values manually, applying defaults.
* Be precise with node labels, properties, and relationship types, ensuring each unique entity has a corresponding node. ESG categories should be represented by ESGCategory nodes (e.g., Environment, Social, Governance).
* Do not include any sample values from the example data in the Cypher query. Use only generic field references like `entry.FieldName`.
* Assume headers in the first row are complete and do not contain any empty fields. Apply default values only to data rows if fields are empty or missing.
* The output should be valid JSON with no line breaks. Do not add line breaks to the output.
